# Code Splitting

The repository contains all ReactJS relevant configurations.

- Webpack
- Webpack Dev Server
- Babel
- TypeScript
- ESLint
- Babel
- Fast Refresh
- Prettier
- Husky
- Lint staged

Everything is configured on a minimum level to satisfy base requirements for code splitting examples.

However, the whole setup is an overkill for what I intended to do. It was still fun.

## I am proud that I've set up the Fast Refresh

The last time I tried to set it up didn't work out. I spent hours figuring out why it didn't work, but I failed. This time it was surprisingly fast. Below two hours to finish the whole initial setup, compared to last time seven days.
